# Agile Tools & Methodology

## Tools
- **JIRA**: backlog, sprint planning, bug tracking.
- **Trello**: simple Kanban boards for tasks.
- **Azure DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines and repo integration.
- **Slack**: team communication.

## How tools help
- Backlog: store user stories (e.g., "As a user, I want a chatbot that answers legal queries").
- Sprint planning: pick a few stories per 1â€“2 week sprint.
- CI/CD: run automated tests after changes.
- Collaboration: assign tasks, comment, and update statuses.

## Agile benefits
- Iterative development and regular feedback.
- Rapid improvements and early bug detection.
- Easier adaptation when APIs or requirements change.
